Assignment 2

Q1)
	When the minimum x-value is constant and the maximum x-value is changed, then it generally results in lower y-intercept error.
	When the minimum x-value is changed and the maximum x-value is constant, then the error in the y-intercept heavily increases. 
	It can be concluded that when the minimum value of X gets far away from zero and is not constant, while the maximum is constant, then
	the error in the y-intercept will increase.

Q2)
	Locations used: Botswana (southern), Madagascar(southern), Colombia (equator), Austria (northern), Japan (northern)
	
	Scale factors: Botswana - 13, Madagascar - 25, Colombia - 9, Austria - 10.5, Japan - 9

	Offset: Botswana - 0.99, Madagascar - 0.999, Colombia - 0.9615, Austria - 0.975, Japan - 0.985
	
Q3)
	The data values overlap, so the data is not entirely clean. To fix this, you need to edit kater_2_run7 &
	kater_2_run8 files to clean the raw data so the time intervals are more consistent. I found the outlying
	points and modified the values ever so slightly to separate the data that was overlapping.
	The first value for g calculated was 9.7971 +/- 0.0048, the best value for g is 9.8025 +/- 0.1240
	This increase in uncertainty is because there are various errors that cause g to not to be entirely accurate.
	model leaves for a degree of error because it is not the most accurate tool for calculating g.
	The value given has uncertainty and quite a bit, Kater's Pendulum would be the best tool for measuring
	within a percent or two of g. In any experiment there is some degree of error or "crap that happens."
	
	The fudge factor offset is 0.0085, this is a bit large but reasonable because it is only 8.5 thousandths of 1, if the
	offset had to be large enough to go in the tenths place(0.1) or hundreths place(0.01) then this would 
	be unreasonable.
