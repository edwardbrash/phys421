PHYS PROJ 4:

Q1)
	a)	inductance = 2535@u_mH
	
		The maximum gain of this filter is: ~35 dB
		The frequency the maximum gain occurs at is: 10^2 Hz
		
		-> See notebook for plot
	
	b)	inductance = 25.33@u_mH
		
		Swap C and L, along w/ capacitance and inductance values
		
		-> See notebook for plot
		
	c) Rearrange values to match twin-T filter, where you pass it through a combination
		of low & high pass filters, in a specific way. Also edit the notch frequency eq to ensure
		it is set to 60 Hz correctly.
	
		-> See notebook
Q2)
	a)	See notebook
	
	b)	See notebook
	
	c)	See notebook
		b)	Yes, there is a statistically significant trend. The PPG trends upwards up as the year increases.
		
Q3)
	a) Changed the values as requested. Not much is different in my jupyter notebook, the new version got lost but I already had looked at
		various graph changes.
		
		The results for the pressure and velocity distribution makes sense. When the velocity is constant, a jagged and fluctuating graph is the result.
		The pressure allows for some consistency, but is never perfect which causes the fluctuations in velocity.
		
	b)	When the velocity is not constant a smooth curve is observed instead. These results also make sense, it is following an equation: when the volume increases,
		the pressure decreases.
